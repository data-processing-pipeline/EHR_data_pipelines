# EHR_data_pipelines

## Pipeline 1

In this pipeline, we process a dataset and then apply a model to get statistical results in order to solve a problem. 

Here is some code: [for example, a link to a Jupiter notebook that loads a dataset to run an analysis. Preferably, the dataset is in this repo that can be directly loaded into the notebook.]

## Pipeline 2

Another pipeline to do a different type of analysis.
